Use UniConvertor to conver CDR to PDF and start PDF viewer

CDR is CorelDRAW file format that actually a zip package. It contained preview bmps in it. But the thumb pictures are not clearly.

There are a free software named CDR Viewer on the line. But it doesnâ€™t work. If you give a deep look in it. You can find it use UniConvertor which can change one vector graphics format to another. It worked.

You can download UniConvertor from it home site here.

Use this tool, you can convert CDR to SVG or PDF to view. Here I write a batch file to do it automatically. Put this script in cdr2pdfviewer.cmd file and put it in UniConvetor folder. You can drop down cdr file to it or associate all cdr files to this cmd file. Now you can use your favorite PDF viewer to show CDR files. 

You can find this cmd file in this project.

Also, you can find a vc source here too.
